    "### Summary:\n",
    "This project builds and evaluates a Gaussian Naive Bayes classification model for a real-world prediction task. The report is structured in four main parts. First, it explains the mathematical foundation of the model, including Bayes’ Theorem, the independence assumption, and the Gaussian distribution used for continuous features. Next, it walks through the implementation of the model, covering model construction, training and prediction using only Numpy and python by ourselves instead of using scikit-learn. The model is then tested using both unit tests and labeled datasets to verify correctness and measure prediction accuracy. Finally, the report concludes with proper academic citations to support the methods and theory used throughout the project."

    "Naive Bayes (NB) is a simple **probabilistic classification algorithm** based on **Bayes’ theorem** and the assumption that features are **conditionally independent** given the class label. [1]\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Training Phase\n",

    "  where $m$ is the number of possible feature values.  \n",
    "  *(The “+1” term is Laplace smoothing to avoid zero probabilities.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "These probabilities are stored and used for prediction; there is **no iterative optimization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Prediction Phase\n",

This dataset is widely used for binary classification tasks and is well-structured, making it an appropriate choice for evaluating the performance of our **Gaussian Naive Bayes** model.[3]\n"
